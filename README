OVERVIEW

t.py is a tool for problems (tasks) from icpc-style competitions.

Historically it is clone of t.cmd used in IFMO (now ITMO University), written by @burunduk3
in 2009 as t.sh (yes, that was a bash script), then rewritten in python3.

It works with problems: generates tests and make simple checking
It is under development now (and forever), so use it on you own risk.

DOWNLOAD

Better way is to obtain t.py is github: https://github.com/burunduk3/t.sh

INSTALLATION

Currently t.py doesn't need some special files installed somewhere, but it is a python script with
some modules. Be sure python will find them. I just make symlink t.py in some my $PATH to t.py file
in git repository.
