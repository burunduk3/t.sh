OVERVIEW

t.sh is a tool for making acm-style competitions.
It works with problems: generates tests and make simple checking
It is under development now, so use it on you own risk.

DOWNLOAD

Better way is to checkout subversion repository with t.sh, like this:
$ svn checkout http://burunduk3.geins.ru/svn/public/t.sh t.sh-readonly

In this case you will get anonymous read-only access to t.sh. About contributing
and making changes in t.sh, see «IMPORTANT» section below.

INSTALLATION

In general, t.sh is jush a bash script, so it doesn't need to be installed anywhere.
But it can be useful to allow you invoke t.sh from anywhere on your system.

For Windows, enter «windows» subdirectory and run setup.sh from this directory. This
will create t.sh.cmd file, it is wrapper to t.sh. Then add «windows» directory to your
PATH enviropment variable. Easy?

For Linux, just make a symlink to t.sh from any directory from $PATH. For example, I added
directory «~/user/binary» to my $PATH, and made link from ~/user/binary/t.sh to t.sh from
subversion repository.

IMPORTANT

t.sh is in development, it has frequent updates.

*** Please don't make copies of t.sh! ***
*** Commit all you changes of t.sh into svn! ***

Exception is then you make some specific changes that can be useful only for you.

There are two ways to make changes to t.sh:
 — Write to burunduk3@gmail.com description of you changes and new t.sh. I will
merge code and publish it to svn by myself.
 — Commit changes into svn. For that you will need login and password. Write to
burunduk3@gmail.com if you don't have any. And you will need write-access to svn.
Just checkout you work copy with «https» instead of «http» in link above from
section «DOWNLOAD»

Thank you!
